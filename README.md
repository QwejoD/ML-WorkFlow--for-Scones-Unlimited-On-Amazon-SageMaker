# ML-WorkFlow--for-Scones-Unlimited-On-Amazon-SageMaker

Image Classifiers are used in the field of computer vision to identify the content of an image and it is used across a broad variety of industries, from advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles and augmented reality, to eCommerce platforms, and even in diagnostic medicine.

As a Machine Learning Engineer for a scone-delivery-focused logistics company, Scones Unlimited, and youâ€™re working to ship an Image Classification model. The image classification model can help the team in a variety of ways in their operating environment: detecting people and vehicles in video feeds from roadways, better support routing for their engagement on social media, detecting defects in their scones, and many more!

In this project, an image classification model that can automatically detect which kind of vehicle delivery drivers have was built. This would aid in routing them to the correct loading bay and orders. Assigning delivery professionals who have a bicycle to nearby orders and giving motorcyclists orders that are farther can help Scones Unlimited optimize their operations.

### In this project, AWS Sagemaker was used to build an image classification model that can tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. 
The model was deployed, 
AWS Lambda functions and AWS Step Functions was used to compose the model and services into an event-driven application. 

## Project Steps Overview
Step 1: Data staging
Step 2: Model training and deployment
Step 3: Lambdas and step function workflow
Step 4: Testing and evaluation
